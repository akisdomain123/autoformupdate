Detailed Explanation
Imports and Configuration:

The script imports Selenium modules for browser automation and required functionalities (Options, By, Keys).
Specifies the paths for:
chrome_driver_path: Path to the Chrome WebDriver executable, required for automating Chrome or Brave browsers.
brave_path: Path to the Brave browser executable, as the script uses Brave for automation.
Data Preparation:

The data dictionary contains the predefined information to be entered into the form, such as:
Phone number, owner name, company name, category, email, location details, and profile information.
Browser Setup:

Configures the WebDriver to use Brave by setting the binary_location to the brave_path.
Initializes the WebDriver with the specified Chrome Driver path and Brave browser configuration.
Navigating to the Form:

Opens the registration form at the URL https://activities.parentnetwork.io/vendorForm/registerforms.php.
Locating Form Fields:

Uses find_element to locate input fields by their ID attributes, such as:
phone for the phone number input.
name for the owner's name input.
display_name for the company name input.
category for the category input.
email_address for the email input.
location_country for the country input.
location_address for the city input.
profile_details for the profile description input.
Filling Out the Form:

Inputs data from the data dictionary into each corresponding form field using the .send_keys() method.
Identifying the Submit Button:

Finds all buttons on the page using find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "button").
Filters the buttons to locate the one with the visible text "Submit".
Assigns this button to the submit_button variable.
Submit Action (Commented Out):

The final line to click the submit button (submit_button.click()) is commented out. If uncommented, this would submit the form.
